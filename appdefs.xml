CrashPlan makes it easy to protect your digital life, so you can get back to
what’s important in real life.  Only CrashPlan offers totally free local and
offsite backup. A subscription to the cloud backup service gets you continuous
backup, mobile file access and lots more. For the ultimate in computer backup,
get all three, from the same easy application.

        <title level="2">Networking</title>
        <content>
By default, the container runs in bridge mode networking.  This is the best way
to go, unless your CrashPlan container is the backup destination of other
devices on your local network (LAN).

In this network mode, a private IP address on an isolated subnet is assigned to
containers.  For example, devices on your LAN may have IP addresses in the
`192.168.1.x` subnet, while containers have IP addresses in the `172.17.x.x`
range.  Thus, CrashPlan detects and reports a local/internal IP address in the
`172.17.x.x` subnet, something that other devices on your LAN cannot reach.

**NOTE**: The problem described here doesn't affect the scenario where your
CrashPlan container is the backup destination of other devices located *outside*
your LAN (i.e. over the Internet).  In this case, CrashPlan uses your public IP
address, which is properly detected no matter the networking mode.

The first solution to this issue is to add a static route on your router to
allow other devices to reach your CrashPlan container.  The way to configure
routes is different for each router, but here is the route information you will
need:
```
Subnet IP address:  172.17.0.0
Subnet mask:        255.255.0.0
Subnet prefix size: /16
Gateway:            IP address of your Docker host
```

The second solution is to run the container in host mode networking.  This mode
effectively disables network isolation of a Docker container. The container
shares the networking namespace of the host, meaning that it shares the same IP
address and is directly exposed to your LAN.  Consequently, port mappings are
note used/needed.  Note that this mode increases chances to conflict with other
containers or services running on the host.  To enable the host mode networking,
run the container with the `--net=host` parameter.

For more information, see the [Docker container networking] documentation.

        <title level="2">Taking Over Existing Backup</title>
        <content>
If this container is replacing a CrashPlan installation (from Linux, Windows,
MAC or another Docker container), your existing backup can be taken over to
avoid re-uploading all your data.

To proceed, make sure to carefully read the [official documentation].

Here is a summary of what needs to be done:
  1. Start CrashPlan Docker container.  Make sure the configuration directory
     if not mapped to a folder used by a different CrashPlan container.
  2. Sign in to your account.
  3. Perform an adoption.  There is a gray banner asking you to do so.
  4. Once done, you will probably see missing items in the file selection.  This
     is normal, since path to your files is different in the container.
  5. Update the file selection by re-adding your files.  **Do not unselect
     missing items yet**.
  6. Perform a backup.  Because of deduplication, files will not be uploaded
     again.
  7. Once the backup is terminated, you can remove missing items **if you
     don't care about file versions**.  Else, keep missing items.
  8. If you are the destination for other computers, you have to adjust the
     location of previous backup archives.  In the `Inbound` section, if some of
     your friends have the message `Backup disabled - backup location is not
     accessible`: click on the name, then update the location.  It should be
     under `/backupArchives/&lt;Computer ID&gt;`.

        <title level="3">Crashes / Maximum Amount of Allocated Memory</title>
        <content>
If CrashPlan crashes unexpectedly with large backups, try to increase the
maximum amount of memory CrashPlan is allowed to use. This can be done by:

  1. Setting the `CRASHPLAN_SRV_MAX_MEM` environment variable.  See the
     [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) section for more details.
  2. Using the [solution provided by CrashPlan] from its support site.

      </section>
      <section>
        <title level="3">Inotify's Watch Limit</title>
        <content>
If CrashPlan exceeds inotify's max watch limit, real-time file watching cannot
work properly and the inotify watch limit needs to be increased on the **host**,
not the container.

For more details, see the CrashPlan's [Linux real-time file watching errors]
article.
        </content>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title level="4">Synology</title>
        <content>
On Synology NAS, the instuctions provided by the article mentioned in the
previous section apply, except that the inotify's max watch limit must be set in
`/etc.defaults/sysctl.conf` (instead of `/etc/sysctl.conf`) to make the setting
permanent.

**NOTE**: After an upgrade of the DSM software, verify that the content of the
file has not been overwritten.

        <title level="3">Connection Between Computers</title>
        <content>
If you have connection issues between your computers, make sure to read the
[Connection between computers] article from CrashPlan support site.

When changing the inbound backup port from CrashPlan settings, don't forget to
also add the proper port mapping when running the container.  For example, if
the listening port is changed to `12345`, the option `-p 12345:12345` needs to
be added to the `docker run` command.

        <title level="3">Command-Line Interface Disappears After Running Command</title>
        <content>
After entering a command in the command-line interface, the window immediately
disappear.  This is a known issue, but it should be noted that the requested
command is still executed as requested.

If the result and/or output of the command is needed, consult the log file
located at `log/service.log.0` in the config directory of container.  Here is
an example of log messages produced when running the `version` command:

```
[03.05.18 06:03:17.179 INFO  MQ-UI-1      backup42.service.ui.UIController] UserActionRequest: CommandMessage[version]
[03.05.18 06:03:17.179 INFO  MQ-UI-1      kup42.common.command.CliExecutor] RUN COMMAND: version  >  CommandResult@1111973668[ version, success=true, result=4.8.4 - 1436674800484 (2015-07-12T04:20:00:484+0000) - Build: 15 ]

        <title level="3">Forcing Sign-In When Access To CrashPlan Requires Password</title>
        <content>
CrashPlan can be configured to require a password to access the application.
Enabling this option ensures no one else can make changes to settings or
restore files without the account password.

Sign-in is needed when the application is started.  Since the application is
always running in this container, a manual step is required to replace the
action of closing the application:
  1. Double click on the CrashPlan logo to open the command-line interface.
  2. Type `exit` and then press the Enter key.

After a few seconds, the CrashPlan application closes and then automatically
restarts.  At this point, password of the account is required to continue.
        </content>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title level="3">Upgrade Failed Error Message</title>
        <content>
Because the CrashPlan's self-upgrade feature is disabled in this container, an
error message about failed upgrade can be seen when a new CrashPlan version is
released.

To fix this, [updating the container's image](#docker-image-update) to the
latest version will also bring the latest version of CrashPlan.

        <description>Maximum amount of memory the CrashPlan Engine is allowed to use. One of the following memory unit (case insensitive) should be added as a suffix to the size: `G`, `M` or `K`.  By default, when this variable is not set, a maximum of 1024MB (`1024M`) of memory is allowed.  **NOTE**: Setting this variable as the same effect as running the `java mx VALUE, restart` command from the CrashPlan command line.</description>
